# MACH-IV

The MACH-IV is a psychological assessment tool designed to measure Machiavellianism, a personality trait characterized by cunning, manipulation, and a focus on self-interest.

## Overview

Developed by Richard Christie and Florence L. Geis in 1970, the MACH-IV consists of 20 items that assess an individual's agreement with Machiavellian statements. The test is named after Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, a 16th-century Italian diplomat and political theorist known for his pragmatic and often cynical views on human nature and politics.

## Scoring

Participants rate their agreement with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". The total score can range from 20 to 140, with higher scores indicating a greater tendency towards Machiavellianism.

## Interpretation

- Scores below 60: Low Machiavellian
- Scores between 60 and 100: Average Machiavellian
- Scores above 100: High Machiavellian

High scorers tend to be more manipulative, cynical about human nature, and more likely to use others for personal gain. Low scorers are generally more trusting, honest, and concerned with ethical behavior.

## Criticisms

While widely used, the MACH-IV has faced criticism for potential social desirability bias and the dated nature of some of its items. Some researchers have proposed updated versions or alternative measures of Machiavellianism.
