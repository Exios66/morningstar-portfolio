Short Dark Triad 3 (SDT3) Assessment

The Short Dark Triad 3 (SDT3) is a 27-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure the Dark Triad personality traits: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy.

## Overview

- **Items**: 27
- **Scoring**: 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)
- **Subscales**: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy

## Questionnaire Items

### Machiavellianism

1. "It's not wise to tell your secrets."
2. "I like to use clever manipulation to get my way."
3. "Whatever it takes, you must get the important people on your side."
4. "Avoid direct conflict with others because they may be useful in the future."
5. "It's wise to keep track of information that you can use against people later."
6. "You should wait for the right time to get back at people."
7. "There are things you should hide from other people because they don't need to know."
8. "Make sure your plans benefit you, not others."
9. "Most people can be easily manipulated."

### Narcissism

1. "People see me as a natural leader."
2. "I hate being the center of attention." (**REVERSED**)
3. "Many group activities tend to be dull without me."
4. "I know that I am special because everyone keeps telling me so."
5. "I like to get acquainted with important people."
6. "I feel embarrassed if someone compliments me." (**REVERSED**)
7. "I have been compared to famous people."
8. "I am just an average person." (**REVERSED**)
9. "I insist on getting the respect I deserve."

### Psychopathy

1. "I like to get revenge on authorities."
2. "I avoid dangerous situations at all costs." (**REVERSED**)
3. "Payback needs to be quick and nasty."
4. "People often say I'm out of control."
5. "It's true that I can be mean to others."

7. "I have never gotten into trouble with the law." (**REVERSED**)
8. "I enjoy having sex with people I hardly know."
9. "I'll say anything to get what I want."

## Scoring

1. Calculate the mean score for each subscale (Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy).
2. For reversed items (Narcissism: 2, 6, 8; Psychopathy: 2, 7), use the following conversion:
   - 1 becomes 5
   - 2 becomes 4
   - 3 remains 3
   - 4 becomes 2
   - 5 becomes 1

## Interpretation

Higher scores on each subscale indicate a stronger presence of that particular Dark Triad trait:

- **Machiavellianism**: Strategic thinking, manipulation, and pragmatic morality
- **Narcissism**: Grandiosity, pride, and lack of empathy
- **Psychopathy**: Impulsivity, thrill-seeking, and lack of remorse
