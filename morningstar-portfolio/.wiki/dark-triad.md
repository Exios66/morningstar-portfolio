# Dark Triad

The Dark Triad is a group of three personality traits: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy. These traits are called "dark" because of their malevolent qualities.

## Overview

The Dark Triad was first introduced by Delroy L. Paulhus and Kevin M. Williams in 2002. These traits share several features:

- Callousness
- Manipulativeness
- Lack of empathy

## Components

1. **Machiavellianism**: Named after Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, it involves manipulation and exploitation of others, cynicism, and pragmatic morality.

2. **Narcissism**: Characterized by grandiosity, pride, egotism, and a lack of empathy.

3. **Psychopathy**: Involves antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, callousness, and remorselessness.

## Measurement

The Dark Triad is often measured using the Short Dark Triad (SD3) questionnaire or through individual assessments of each trait.

## Implications

Understanding the Dark Triad is crucial in various fields:

- Clinical Psychology
- Organizational Behavior
- Criminology

## Criticisms

Some researchers argue for the inclusion of other traits, such as sadism, forming the "Dark Tetrad."
