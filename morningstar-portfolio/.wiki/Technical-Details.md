# Technical Details

This section provides information for developers and technical users about the architecture, technologies, and implementation details of the Dark Triad Assessments Web Application.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with CSS Variables for theming
- **Charts and Visualizations**: Chart.js library
- **Mathematical Computations**: Math.js library
- **LaTeX Rendering**: MathJax library
- **Version Control**: Git (hosted on GitHub)

## Application Structure

The application is primarily contained within a single `index.html` file, which includes embedded CSS and JavaScript. This structure was chosen for simplicity and ease of deployment as a static site.

### Key Components

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Semantic HTML5 elements for improved accessibility and SEO
   - Modular sections for different assessments and features

2. **CSS Styling**
   - Use of CSS variables for easy theming and dark mode implementation
   - Responsive design using flexbox and media queries
   - Animations for smooth transitions and improved user experience

3. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - Object-oriented approach for organizing assessment questions and logic
   - Event-driven programming for user interactions
   - Modular functions for different statistical analyses and visualizations

## Key Features Implementation

### Dark Mode
- Implemented using CSS variables and a JavaScript toggle function
- Dynamically updates chart colors for consistency

### Assessment Engine
- Uses a question bank stored in a JavaScript object
- Implements auto-advance functionality using `setInterval`
- Calculates scores based on user responses, accounting for reversed items

### Data Export/Import
- Utilizes the `Blob` API and `URL.createObjectURL` for file downloads
- FileReader API for importing and parsing uploaded files

### Statistical Analyses
- Leverages the Math.js library for complex mathematical operations
- Implements various statistical formulas directly in JavaScript

### Data Visualization
- Utilizes Chart.js for creating interactive and responsive charts
- Custom configuration for each chart type to match the application's design

## Performance Considerations

- Lazy loading of certain scripts and resources
- Use of `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Efficient DOM manipulation to minimize repaints and reflows

## Security Considerations

- All data processing is done client-side, ensuring user data privacy
- No external API calls or data storage, minimizing potential security risks

## Browser Compatibility

- Designed to work on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses ES6+ features, so older browsers may not be fully supported

## Future Development Considerations

- Potential migration to a framework like React or Vue.js for improved state management and component-based architecture
- Implementation of a backend for data persistence and more complex analyses
- Addition of user authentication for personalized experiences and data saving
