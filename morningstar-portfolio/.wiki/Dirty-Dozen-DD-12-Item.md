# The Dirty Dozen Assessment

The Dirty Dozen is a concise 12-item measure designed to assess the Dark Triad personality traits: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, and Psychopathy.

## Overview

- **Items**: 12
- **Scoring**: 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree)
- **Subscales**: Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy

## Questionnaire Items

### Machiavellianism
1. "I tend to manipulate others to get my way."
2. "I have used deceit or lied to get my way."
3. "I have used flattery to get my way."
4. "I tend to exploit others towards my own end."

### Narcissism
5. "I tend to want others to admire me."
6. "I tend to want others to pay attention to me."
7. "I tend to seek prestige or status."
8. "I tend to expect special favors from others."

### Psychopathy
9. "I tend to lack remorse."
10. "I tend to be unconcerned with the morality of my actions."
11. "I tend to be callous or insensitive."
12. "I tend to be cynical."

## Scoring

1. Calculate the mean score for each subscale (Machiavellianism, Narcissism, Psychopathy).
2. The overall Dark Triad score can be calculated by averaging all 12 items.

## Interpretation

Higher scores on each subscale indicate a stronger presence of that particular Dark Triad trait:

- **Machiavellianism**: Strategic manipulation and exploitation of others
- **Narcissism**: Grandiosity, egotism, and need for admiration
- **Psychopathy**: Lack of empathy, callousness, and cynicism

Scores can range from 1 to 5 for each subscale and the overall Dark Triad measure.

## Psychometric Properties

- **Reliability**: The Dirty Dozen has demonstrated good internal consistency across various studies.
- **Validity**: It shows strong correlations with longer Dark Triad measures and relevant behavioral outcomes.
- **Efficiency**: Its brevity makes it ideal for research settings where time or questionnaire space is limited.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Quick and easy to administer
- Useful for large-scale surveys or when assessment time is limited
- Demonstrates good psychometric properties despite its brevity

### Limitations
- May not capture the full complexity of the Dark Triad traits
- Some researchers argue it may oversimplify the constructs
